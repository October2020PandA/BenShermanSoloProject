Project:

My plan is to make an E-Commerce site for a made-up record store.

Core Functionality:
1. Users will be able to shop for both vinyl and record-players/equipment.
2. There will be a homepage with an overview of the site, navigation, and customer testimonials.
3. There will be pages to shop for records and pages to shop for equipment, including the ability to narrow a search with genre categories, and pagination at the bottom. I will use AJAX so that this can be done without page refresh.
4. Once a record or piece of equipment is selected, the customer will be taken to a page with information about the specific item they're interested in, including item description, option to choose quantity, and option to add to shopping cart.
5. When users to try buy, if not logged in, they'll be redirected to a login/reg page with validations
6. There will be a checkout page that displays all items currently in the user's cart, and allows them to edit. Here, they'll also be asked to input shipping and billing information. I will use Stripe API for payment.
7. There will be a page that displays after checkout that allows them to access their purchase history
8. The new items that I'll be incorporating are AJAX and Bootstrap. 

Required Features:
1. Users must be able to create an account/log in, search items by category, and add items to their cart.
2. The site must be easy to navigate through search features, and users should be easily able to access their information - items in cart, previous purchases, and payment information if they choose to save it. 


Additional Functionality - If I get to it, I'd love to add:
1. On individual item pages, have an "also by this artist" or "similar albums" section
2. Have another "similar albums" section displayed after user checks out
3. Have a couple of admin pages where admins can log in, update inventory and view sales history.
